Program Documentation:

I used Python library named Pandas. Pandas provides fast, flexible and expressive data structures, mostly used on csv file types.
1.First, I loaded all file data in data frame using Pandas.
2.Then removed all special characters because we are performing arithmetic operation to find difference.
3.Next I store value in new column name "final" and find the max value. 
4.After that, I removed all unnecessary column to get the row with maximum value.
5.And lastly remove header and print the value which is required.

How to run?

Using this command in terminal, run the file. Assuming you have Pandas Library installed.
if not installed use this linux command to install "sudo apt-get install python-pandas"

To Run:
python index.py


Note: This program is developed using Python version 2.7. Python version 3.x may throw errors.
